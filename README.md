✅ Get a fast, responsive app that works seamlessly on all devices without any bugs. I meticulously test the application on different devices like Android and iOS. Additionally, I assess the app's performance using tools such as "React Developer Tools", "Google Lighthouse" and more.
✅ Forget what bad code is. I use best practices for creating an application's file structure and I write tidy, well-organized, and easily comprehensible code.
✅ Collaborate with an experienced developer
